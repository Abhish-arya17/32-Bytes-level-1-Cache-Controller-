# 32-Bytes-level-1-Cache-Controller-
This project presents the design of a direct-mapped 32-byte L1 cache controller (8Ã—4B blocks) with write-through policy and real-time hit/miss tracking. A 40-location ROM simulates data memory. Implemented in Verilog, validated on ModelSim, and synthesized using Xilinx Vivado.
